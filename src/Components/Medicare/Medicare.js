            These plans offer an alternative way to get your Original Medicare,
            Part A and Part B, benefits. Unlike Original Medicare, Medicare
            Advantage and DSNP plans may also include prescription drug coverage
            (Part D) and additional benefits, like vision, dental, hearing
            coverage, over-the-counter health products, transportation and a
            fitness benefit.

          <p className="large_body">
            You can enroll in a stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that
            can complement your existing Original Medicare (Part A and Part B)
            coverage. These plans cover a formulary of brand and generic
            medications.

            These policies are sold by private insurance companies to help pay
            some of the healthcare costs that Original Medicare (Parts A and B)
            doesn't cover. These plans may offer benefits such as assistance
            with deductibles, premiums, and copayment/ coinsurance, as well as
            emergency foreign travel coverage.
