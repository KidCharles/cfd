            CareFree Direct works with consumers to find affordable Medicare
            coverage that meets their healthcare needs. CareFree Directâ€™s
            licensed agents can match consumers with a variety of Medicare
            coverage options including Medicare Advantage (MA or MAPD), Dual
            Special Needs Plans (DSNP), Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage
            (PDP) and Medicare Supplement Plans (Medigap). CareFree Direct
            offers these plans through a wide range of private insurance
            companies that contract with Medicare.

          <p className="large_body">
            These plans offer an alternative way to get your Original Medicare,
            Part A and Part B, benefits. Unlike Original Medicare, Medicare
            Advantage and DSNP plans may also include prescription drug coverage
            (Part D) and additional benefits, like vision, dental, hearing
            coverage, over-the-counter health products, transportation and a
            fitness benefit.

            You can enroll in a stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that
            can complement your existing Original Medicare (Part A and Part B)
            coverage. These plans cover a formulary of brand and generic
            medications.
          </p>
          <h1 className="title">Medicare Supplement Plans (Medigap)</h1>
          <p className="large_body">
            These policies are sold by private insurance companies to help pay
            some of the healthcare costs that Original Medicare (Parts A and B)
            doesn't cover. These plans may offer benefits such as assistance
            with deductibles, premiums, and copayment/ coinsurance, as well as
            emergency foreign travel coverage.
